## How to install

Until I have a better way to pack and publish it, the process is kinda manual

1. Clone this project;
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn build`

### Chrome

1. open a new tab with `chrome://extensions/`
2. enable developer mode
3. select `Load unpacked`
4. browse and open the `extension` folder

### Firefox

1. open a new tab with `about:debugging`
2. select `This Firefox` tab
3. click on `Load Temporary Add-on...`
4. browse and open `extension/manifest.json` file
